# Mode-wise Tensor Decomposition

This repository is for our paper:

[1] HanQin Cai, Keaton Hamm, Longxiu Huang, and Deanna Needell. <a href=https://jmlr.org/papers/v22/21-0287.html>Mode-wise Tensor Decompositions: Multi-dimensional Generalizations of CUR Decompositions</a>. *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, 22.185: 1-36, 2021.


## Introduction
In this work, we generalize CUR decompositions to high-order tensors under the low-multilinear-rank setting.  
We provide two verisons of this generalization, namely Chidori and Fiber CUR decompositions.  


## Environment
This repo is developed with <a href=https://gitlab.com/tensors/tensor_toolbox/-/releases/v3.1>Tensor Toolbox v3.1</a>. A future verison of this toolbox may also increase the preformance of our code; however, we cannot guarantee their compatibility.
